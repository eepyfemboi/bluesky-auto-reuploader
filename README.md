# bluesky-auto-reuploader
a personal project i made to automatically repost stuff that i post on twitter over to bluesky

its made in a super roundabout way using a discord bot, so if you don't know what you're doing, i probably wont help u

essentially, to use this, first you would have to [set up this bot](https://discord.com/application-directory/1174332637322674186) in a discord server, then copy the channel id of where you set it up to the appropriate spot in the code

anyone trying to use this should already know how to set up a discord bot, and if u dont, then ur SOL

anyway, fix the broken imports (figure out what the functions do urself, or ask chatgpt), then open bluesky in ur web browser on ur pc, open dev tools, switch to the network tab, and make a post and find the request, then right click and copy as node.js, and paste into a new text document

after that, paste the request logs and the entire script into chatgpt and ask it to fill in the missing request details based on the information provided by the request logs. it should work. if it doesnt, then just figure it out urself ig. if chatgpt doesnt work then ur best bet is to just use dev tools to record any requests that the script would need to make and copy the request headers over manually

after that, find somewhere to host ur bot and it should probably work

disclaimer: ive been awake for over 50 hours at this point, im tired as shit, and i put as little effort as i could into this project, and i dont wanna spend any more time on it than i have to, so if u have any issues then ur on ur own. try asking on stackoverflow
